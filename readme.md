# Trey's Code Partials

## What is this?
This is a library of modules, parts, snippets, partials, chunks... Whatever you want to call it, this is a collection of useful chunks of code. The point of this is to collect the things I find myself reaching for time and time again, the answers to the problems that present themselves over and over. This library is mostly for self reference, but its information that others may find useful as well.


## Questions & Contributions
If you have any questions on implementation for these things, or if you would like to contribute to the repo, please open an issue or submit a pull request.  I'm always interested in improving my tools.  

## Should I use the code found here? 
Probably not, I don't think I would anymore. It needs some serious revision and update. Good Luck!
